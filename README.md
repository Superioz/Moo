# MooProject
A minecraft network communication system based on netty (Some call it 'Cloud system', which is not quite correct).

This project was originally written for a minecraft network, but after it went down I decided to share it on Github.  
It is not finished, thus you may have to test and finish it yourself if you want to use the whole thing before I finish it myself.

**You can use the code however you want - without restrictions.**
