# MooProject
A minecraft network communication system based on netty

This project was originally written for a minecraft network, but after it went down I decided to share it on Github.  
It is not finished, thus you may have to test and finish it yourself if you want to use the whole thing.

**You can use the code however you want, without restrictions.**
