# Here you can edit (nearly) all messages. But keep in mind that these messages
# are not just randomly chosen, they mirror the sense of what the player needs to know
# so choose your new messages wisely!
#
# - Use '\n' for a new line inside the message
# - Character set: UTF-8 (so umlauts [correct english word for German:Umlaut, lol) can be used)
#   - If the character set doesn't work, try to set it manually (e.g. with Notepad++)
#
# Replacement system (order: numbers -> the rest chronologically)
# =========================================================================
# For simple replacements use either '{$number}' or '%placeholder%'.
# $number = a number between 0 and 9 (e.g. {0} or {6})
# $placeholder = a short representing text (e.g. %player% or %amount%)
#
# You can also use placeholders with the format '{$messageId}' to use other messages from
# these properties. Example: '{click-to-execute}' would display the message of the property
# behind this name.
#
# If you want to use the event system (hover and click events) use this format:
# '${"$text","$hoverEventContent","$clickEventContent"}$'
# $text = the text to be displayed later on in the whole message
# $hoverEventContent = can be a text or whatever the hover action needs for working.
# $clickEventContent = can be a command or whatever the click action needs for working.
# You can also use numbers in front of the apostrophes of each event content to set
# the event action (the number represents the action's ordinal number)
# Example: '${"$text",1"$hoverEventContent",2"$clickEventContent"}$' would show an achievement as hover event
# and would execute a command as click event. (The ordinal numbers should be documented at the spigot open source)
#
# For parts which can either be one or another value use the decider syntax:
# '{"decision1"|"decision2"}' (e.g.: '{"activated"|"deactivated"}')
# This can be useful if a variable can be of two different values which should
# be displayed differently (e.g. boolean [true|false] values)
# =========================================================================
